# PySpark_Binary_Classification_ML_Model
Binary Classification Models Using PySpark Package In Hadoop Big Data Environment

Disclaimer: This code snippet is developed with an intension for generic use only. I hereby declare that the code was not part of any of my professional development work. Also, no sensitive or confidential data sources are used for this development.

Description: The repository consists of below list of machine learning models for binary classification problems:

	1. Logistic Regression
	2. Random Forest
	3. SVM
	4. GBM

Note:
1. This scripts taking raw csv file as a input source, however Hive integration is possible with very minimal changes 
2. User Input Section allows to set all model parameters as well as data source specification. Users dont need to edit anything except this    section. This is a fully automated end to end code.
3. This script also perform basic EDA, Feature Engineering and Random Sampling based on user given test split
4. Only test sample model evaluation metrices are reported

Compatibility: The code is developed and tested on Zeppelin Notebook in Hadoop Big Data Environment using Python 3.7
